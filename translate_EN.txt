For all DS and DSiWare games, the title IDs can be found in:\n<https://www.gametdb.com/dstdb.txt?LANG={0}>\nor at the bottom of a DS Game Card.\nFor all WiiWare, Channels, VC, etc., the title IDs can be found in:\n<https://www.gametdb.com/wiitdb.txt?LANG={0}>\nThis is where Wii Game Discs' IDs can be found too, except you need to find the one with the correct publisher code at the end.\nThese are found at <https://www.gametdb.com/WiiCompanies>. However, modifications will modify or remove the publisher code.\nAlso take into account the meaning of the fourth letter: <https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Title_database#Region_Codes>
`^^addping <ID>`: add a game ping.\n`^^delping <ID>`: delete a game ping.\n`^^listpings`: list all of your game pings.\n`^^ping <ID> <message>`: ping all people who have added pings for a certain game.\n`^^query [ID]`: get information on a game, or, if no ID is provided, get instructions to get title IDs.\n`^^translate`: get information on translation and translation credits.
Want to help translate? Great!\nI accept all translations, but at first, only English, Japanese, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Korean will be added. Once I have all of those, I will add Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Taiwanese, and all translations given to me with a translation of the database. Once I have all 12, I will add all translations.\nI also accept translations of the game database, but only if they are given to me along with a translation of the system messages, and they must be updated within 24 hours of a refresh.\nAs for translation itself, retain all Discord formatting and Python `str.format()` rules. Also, the list of publishers and list of region codes found when using `^^query` without an argument are available only in English, so please use:\n`https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=en&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gametdb.com%2FWiiCompanies`\n`https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=en&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwiibrew.org%2Fwiki%2FTitle_database%23Region_Codes`\nThen opt to translate to the correct language, copy the resulting URL, and (importantly) indicate that the correct letters are visible only in the original. As for the GameTDB databases, the titles are likely to only be known in a language which is already available, but if you do wish to give a copy in a different language, you should probably translate it yourself.\nEnglish translation by Sara-L: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mOSU-eof/game-bot/master/translate_EN.txt>
