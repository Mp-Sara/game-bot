Want to help translate? Great!\nI accept all translations, but at first, only English, Japanese, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Korean will be added. Once I have all of those, I will add Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, and Taiwanese. Once I have all 12, I will add all translations.\nAs for translation itself, retain all Discord formatting and Python `str.format()` rules.
